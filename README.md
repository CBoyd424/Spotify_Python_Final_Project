# Spotify Python Final Project
In this case study, we will be exploring 2017-2020 data from Spotify with Python to discover the popularity of artists and genres across the world. 

The project begins with cleaning the data and performing an extensive exploratory data analysis to develop some researh questions and form a hypothesis. The hypothesis was then tested using suoervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to accept or reject the null hypothesis. The first technique was linear regression, followed by clustering since we didnt get the results we expected with the regression analysis. 

Although there is what seems like an infinite amount of experiments that could be conducted, the results from this specific hypotheis were recorded in a dashboard with Tableau for stakeholders. 

## Exploratory Research Questions: 
  • Do countries share the same top ranking artists or songs?

  • Is there a correlation between popularity of an artist and being in the top 50 charts?

  • Are there different genres that are most popular per country?
